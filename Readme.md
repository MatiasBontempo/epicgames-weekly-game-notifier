# EpicGames Weekly Game Notifier

EWGS is a Discord bot that will remind your server about EpicGames free weekly games. Every time there's an update, you will hear it from this lovely companion.

## Instructions

First, go ahead and create a new `#updates` channel if you don't have one. Right now this step is necesary as the bot only knows how to post automatic updates there.

Then, you need to authorize the bot using the following link: <https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=662478067310133248&scope=bot&permissions=3072>

That's it! Now EWGS will be ready to notify your server about the new *epic games* :wink:

## Commands

There's only one command you can use right now. In case you don't want to create the `#updates` channel or the bot is not allowed to write messages on it, you can write `!epic` and the bot will respond with list of games.

## Support

If you have any issue, something is not working the right way or you have any suggestion, feel free to DM me in Twitter [@MatiasBontempo](https://twitter.com/MatiasBontempo).
